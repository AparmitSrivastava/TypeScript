let greeting:string = "hello brother"

let myNum= 6;
// myNum.toUpperCase()
// this (line 4) gives an error


greeting.toLowerCase()
// greeting. ----when we write . it automatically suggest me functions that are part of only and only strinf and not other type
console.log(greeting);

export{}
// this export line is used here to temporarily remove the red line error and give peace of mind ,, we will study about it later/
